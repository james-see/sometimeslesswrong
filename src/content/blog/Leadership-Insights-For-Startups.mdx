The following is an always up to date list of insights I've been able to distill from working as a technical leader at 3 early stage startups and counting.

<CopyableParagraph id="insight-1" content="I want all of us to be student and teacher, coach and player, own and delegate." number={1} />

<CopyableParagraph id="insight-2" content="There is no binary solution at the individual level that works and can be abstracted to what is best for any group. At best it is a plot on a graph as a time series and a best fit curve that moves forward. Bayesian wins. At best leaders keep the standard deviation down." number={2} />

<CopyableParagraph id="insight-3" content="Product should lead what is built, but engineering should lead how it is build. Product is the only way to get to market." number={3} />

<CopyableParagraph id="insight-4" content="Have a minimal meeting mindset. If you are scheduling a meeting with more than one person, ensure it is necessary vs. something that can be handled async." number={4} />

<CopyableParagraph id="insight-5" content="Meetings kill productivity. Have one meeting to define requirements for a project, get clarification, ensure scope and risks are defined, and then do the work. This meeting should include an RFC and a PRD that everyone already is aware of and has as read-aheads prior to the meeting." number={5} />

<CopyableParagraph id="insight-6" content="Don't gatekeep information. Enable information flow by being radically transparent to the entire company as much as possible to ensure context is there if anyone needs it. This requires trust and accountability from everyone." number={6} />

<CopyableParagraph id="insight-7" content="Set deadlines and adhere to them. Track them and adjust scope and level of effort accordingly per engineering project owner." number={7} />

<CopyableParagraph id="insight-8" content="Don't gossip. Gossip is a waste of time. It is not helpful to share your private convos with others. It is helpful to share your ideas and ship your best work." number={8} />

<CopyableParagraph id="insight-9" content="Culture is magic. You are the magician. As a leader, show how your tricks are performed and help everyone see the magic so they can perform it themselves. Not every company has the same tricks, but everyone has the ability to perform magic given the opportunity." number={9} />

<CopyableParagraph id="insight-10" content="Don't schedule regular 1:1s. They are not effective. Instead, schedule them when you need them most. This is a rare opportunity to talk about anything and everything. Wait until you have something you need to address with the individual." number={10} />

<CopyableParagraph id="insight-11" content="Have just enough structure to not have mass chaos. To figure this out, remove all structure and see what turns into chaos and add in the order as needed via tools for developers, product, and management. This is easily overdone and a huge waste of time to clean up after the fact or to educate on tooling vs. shipping new features." number={11} />
